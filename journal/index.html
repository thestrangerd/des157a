                    Game design principles and dark UX practices are intriguing to learn about as an avid video game player. Drawing from my experiences both playing and designing my own games, I can further understand developer goals.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    What fascinates me are the dark UX practices games employ to manipulate or monetize off their consumers. Anyone who has played a mobile game has been prey to such practices. For example, unremovable ad banners, shops to pay for in-game currency, or pervasive irrelevant ads between levels. It was interesting to learn how even UI contributes to this according to <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a> by Amir Dori. Placing sliders at comfortable positions incentivizes scrolling, while offering ads or spending special "gems" to continue/speed up playing incentivizes currency-spending or ad-watching.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    A game that I have been playing recently called CapybaraGo! is a prime example of dark UX. Below is an example of the store button located on the home page. On nearly every button, there are large, pervasive, red notification badges signaling an ad can be watched. This is a method to incentivize users to watch ads, so they may remove the badges. The only other way to remove the badge is to purchase a "no ads" pack for $10 real money.
                </p>

                <div class="pic-example">
                    <img src="images/game1.jpg" alt="store button with red notification badge on top right corner">
                    <img src="images/game2.jpg" alt="chests in store with watchable ads">
                </div>
                <figcaption>A large red notification badge on the store button to signal watchable ads.</figcaption>

                <p class="text">
                    So, as UI/UX designers dabbling into game design, it is important to maintain ethical boundaries and build trust with users. That way, users and developers can create positive relationships, which ultimately benefit both parties.

                <h2>Every Picture Project </h2>
                <p class="date">Journal Four <time datetime="2025-01-13"><img src="../images/heart.svg" alt="heart" class="heart"> Feb 13, 2025</time></p>

                <p class="text">
                    For the upcoming Every Picture Project, my classmate <a href="https://markm-web.github.io/des157a/" target="_blank">Mark Ma</a> is focusing on his PC parts. His images are simple top-down captures over a white counter space. His main goal is to highlight each element on hover and on-click create an overlay representing where and when he purchased that part. However, given the photo's simple nature, there is little room for particular interest or intrigue.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    One suggestion I gave was to reflect on any personal stories. Are there fun moments buying them? Are there blemishes that make them personal to him? Could you change the angles to view them in a different light than just eagle-view? I believe it could even be more interesting for the user to click to "open the PC." For example, clicking opens the PC case lid and users can see all the parts sitting in the PC. Then, each part is highlighted on hover.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    We also explored the possibility of using other topics. He thought about using comic books, but seemed hesitant to commit. If he pursues the comic book idea, I think it would be fun to have the books lined on a bookshelf with only the spine visible. Users can hover and click on each to reveal what the comic book is. It could be a simple way to convey information differently.

                    As for my Every Picture Project, I want to explore the topic of my <span>childhood stuffed animals</span>. Although I have many stuffed animals in my collection, there are only a few that hold dear memories. As of now, I believe my images are also quite simple with little interest or intrigue. One idea I had was to take multiple pictures of each stuffie to create a short animation. For example, my penguin may rotate left and right to create a waddle effect. My bunny might wave its arm to express a little of its personality. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="text">
                    As I brainstormed, I thought about what I wanted to highlight in my project. Despite focusing on my childhood stuffed animal collection, the main feeling I wanted to convey was nostalgia. It led me to think about my family's photo books filled with old printed family photographs. I want to explore that aspect more. Each page will be dedicated to a different stuffie, or even feature photos of my younger self (if I can find any). The animals will be animated and users can click on them to learn more. I also want to implement a page turning feature. I want to capture the nostalgia both through the images and the book setting.

                <h2>Visual Thinking </h2>
                <p class="date">Journal Three <time datetime="2025-01-29"><img src="../images/heart.svg" alt="heart" class="heart"> Feb 08, 2025</time></p>

                <p class="text">
                    Visual thinking is the ability to analyze and interpret images through various viewpoints. Oftentimes, our eyes quickly scan visuals. Therefore it is important to provide images that spark curiosity. According to <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/" target="_blank">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills"</a> by Michael Gonchar, media literacy teaches essential reading and visual thinking skills. Users can gain practice by sharing observations, asking open-ended questions, noticing small details, listening to other observations, and overall looking at the bigger picture. 
                </p>

                <div class="pic-example">
                    <img src="images/sewer-man.jpg" alt="man in dirty brown water up to mouth on left side, police on motorcycle on right looking at man">
                    <img src="images/snow-sheep.jpg" alt="legs sticking out of a large snow pile, three sheep lied down next to it">
                </div>

                <p class="text">
                    Pertaining to web design, images and interactions with users can create novel user experiences. An incredible portfolio I came across uses imagery, videos, and animations spectacularly. <a href="https://matvoyce.tv/" target="_blank">Mat Voyce's portfolio</a> has incredible user interactivity and diverse content. Each page, even within the same category, boasts  countless dynamic animated elements. These include different forms of page navigation (scrolling vs. panning), various transitional and loading screens, and videos showcasing each of his works. His typographic and motion graphic specialities are evident from his homepage alone. 
                </p>

                </video>
                
                <p class="text">
                    However, with fun interactive experiences comes some drawbacks. One example are performance issues. With so many animations playing at once, users with slower devices may face longer loading times or jagged animations, heavily affecting user flow. Furthermore, it may introduce navigation complexities. Those who seek straightforward navigation may be overwhelmed, lost, or confused on the site and may leave quickly. Balance between expression and usability is most important. Overall, Mat's portfolio inspires visual thinking through its unique design experience, encouraging users to engage with the type, rather than only reading it as text.

                <h2>Modals & Overlays</h2>
                <p class="date">Journal Two <time datetime="2025-01-29"><img src="../images/heart.svg" alt="heart" class="heart"> Jan 29, 2025</time></p>

                <p class="text">
                    <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c" target="_blank">Modals</a> can be an extremely useful tool, but it is important to know when to use them. Oftentimes, modals are associated with advertisements or scammy deals upon opening the page. It also requires users to input an extra action to close. This can hinder user experience or disrupt the overall flow. Worse, this can be frustrating for users and prevent access to content or completing tasks. That is when users leave the site for good.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    However, modals do have some good uses. One instance is of confirmation actions. Having a disruptive pop-up for users to confirm or cancel a destructive action draws attention toward their action. Another good use is of initial instructions or tutorials. Getting a couple modal slides of steps can be a good way to introduce actions to users.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    Personally, I do not enjoy using or seeing modals on websites. As a user, I often find them disruptive, especially if there are multiple pop-ups on startup. User interfaces that keep all content on the same page felt the most inviting to me. For example, entering login information on the page, rather than a modal window has the most intuitive flow.

                <h2>Forms</h2>
                <p class="date"><time datetime="2025-01-18">Journal One <img src="../images/heart.svg" alt="heart" class="heart"> Jan 18, 2025</time></p>

                <p class="text">
                    Forms are an essential aspect of interactive design for users to directly input information. They act as the bridge between users and designers. Therefore, it is important to follow the best practices like found in the article "<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">Best practices for form design</a>" by Salim Ansari, to create a smooth and simple user experience. From personal experience, I also recognize many of these practices encourage me to engage further.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    For example, instances like checking out are often abandoned due to long or complicated sequences. Minimal input fields, especially dropdown menus or checkboxes, assist with the tedium. I also heavily rely on step completion bars, as I lose patience easily. Seeing how much I have left to complete makes me much more motivated to finish than unknowingly filling forms for ages. Most of all, I find direct feedback the most helpful. Highlights indicating which tab I am on or specific error messages streamline form processes the most.
                </p>

                <div class="example">
                    <img src="images/google.jpg" alt="password field" width="350" height="172">
                    <figcaption id="google"><span>Google log in password.</span> (Notice how the inline label moves from inside the field to above. There is also a visible blue "selected" highlight and a "Show password" option).</figcaption>
                </div>

                <p class="text">
                    One fantastic example is Google's <a href="https://accounts.google.com/lifecycle/steps/signup/name?ddm=1&dsh=S1529610616:1737254222817859&flowEntry=SignUp&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&TL=AO-GBTdpoztuatMdBA_P1-Pz3agp-3PdqvNZheJEP5BqdMPY3TskSkHkZ9qWbvRE&continue=https://accounts.google.com/ManageAccount?nc%3D1" target="_blank">sign up</a> / <a href="https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?dsh=S1812573153%3A1655944654029516&flowEntry=ServiceLogin&flowName=WebLiteSignIn&ifkv=AX3vH39E0iYVTmn-NoMNM_C35EPrno8LWsRx2Qhr0HApkVLZ-Zc_Vql8ouaSQOiXzEmthrpOPAV5" target="_blank">log in</a> process which features:
